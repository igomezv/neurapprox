# neurapprox

--------------------

**neurapprox** is a Python package that generates neural network approximations for analytical functions, or functions intrinsic to datase. The hyperparameters tunning are made with genetic algorithms. 



## Description of this repository

- neurapprox has the code of the neural approximator.
- chains folder contains some mcmc chains to test the approximation of the posterior probability with neural networks.
- In the models folder, we save in .h5 format the neural networks models. 
- In data folder we have some data used in tests. 


--------------------

## TO DO:

- Automatic tunning of neural netowks with genetic algorithms (DEAP). 
- Read file in NeuralManager (not analytical function).
